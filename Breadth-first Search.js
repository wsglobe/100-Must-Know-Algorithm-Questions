/* The Breadth-first Search algorithm works by traversing a graph level by level. In other words, before traversing any Node's children Nodes, its sibling nodes must be traversed.

*Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(v + e) Time | O(v) Space - where v is the number of vertices of the input graph and e is the number of edges of the input graph
