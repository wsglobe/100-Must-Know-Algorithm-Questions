/* Write a function that takes in a potentially invalid BST and returns a boolean representing whether the BST is valid.
A BST is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid BST nodes.

*Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n) Time | O(d) Space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST and d is the depth(height) of the BST.
