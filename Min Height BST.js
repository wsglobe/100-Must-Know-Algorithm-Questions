/* write a function that takes in a non-empty sorted array of distinct integers, constructs a BST from the integers, and returns the root of the BST. The function should minimize the height of the BST. You've been provided with a BST class that you'll have to use to construct the BST. A BST is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid BST nodes. Note that the BST class has an insert method which you can use if you want.
