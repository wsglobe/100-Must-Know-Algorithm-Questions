/* Write a BST class for a Binary Search Tree. The class should support:
- Inserting values with the insert method.
- Removing values with the remove method; this method should only remove the first instance of a given value.
- Searching for values with the contains method.
Note that you can't remove values from a single-node tree. In other words, calling the remove method on a single-node tree should simply not do anything.
