/* Write three functions that take in a BST and an empty array, traverse the BST, add its nodes' value to the input array, and return that array. The three functions should traverse the BST using the in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree-traversal techniques, respectively.

*Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) Time | O(n) Space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST
