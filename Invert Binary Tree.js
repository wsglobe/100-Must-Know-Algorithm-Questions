/* Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. In other words, the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node.

*Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) Time | O(d) Space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree and d is the depth(height) of the Binary Tree.
