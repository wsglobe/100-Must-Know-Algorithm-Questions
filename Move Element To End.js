/* You're given an array of intergers and an integer. Write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns the array.

Sample Input: 
array = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2] tomove = 2

Sample Output: [1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Note: the numbers 1, 3, 4 could be ordered differently

*Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the array */
